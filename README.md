# Hall-Management
This is a Hall Management Application made for Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST). It will assist the resident students, non-resident students and faculty members with the administrative procedures of resident halls.

More specifically, this application allows the administrators to communicate with the hall residents and notify them when necessary. It also allows the students to submit complaints and apply for seats in the hall. The administrators are easily able to view students info and contact them.
